<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>In the late 1940s, entrepreneurs using simple antennas and Army-surplus coaxial cable created the countrys first cable television systems and revolutionized the way Americans watched TV. More than 70 years later, Infinity (Infinity), the second largest cable provider, owns and manages advanced, well-clustered cable systems throughout the United States.
